A Playground for Dungeon Generator! Have FUN!

##Some Study Notes Here as I am learning the concept of Roguelike Dungeon Generator
 A basic Dungeon Will need the following:
 
 * A Set of itnerconnected rooms, doors and tunnels
 * An entrance
 * An Exit
 * Every space must be reachable

 ##Some Tips from Readings for making a GOOD Dungeon Generator
 
 * It needs to be fairly efficient--generator only runs when the player enters a new level
 * It needs to be connected--from any point in the dungeon, there is a way--posibly circuitous--to any other point
 * It is better that if dungeons to not be perfect--there are more than one ways from one point to the other
 * It would be better to have open rooms
 * It also need to have passageways

some thoughts About architecture of the maze

1. A class object of "room" should have the following propeties: " center location x, y, width, height, corners"

2. First, Room be placed randomly in the stage

3. Stage should have pre-defined or user defined entrance or exit

4. Using" flood fill" Algorithem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill fill all the gap/solid area between randomly placed rooms

5. open gate at rooms to paths generated by step#4 using flood fill method

6. remove dead end path that are not connecting two rooms
