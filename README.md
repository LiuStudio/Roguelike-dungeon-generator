 ## Some Tips from Readings for making a GOOD Dungeon Generator
 *It needs to be fairly efficient--generator only runs when the player enters a new level
 *It needs to be connected--from any point in the dungeon, there is a way--posibly circuitous--to any other point
 *It is better that if dungeons to not be perfect--there are more than one ways from one point to the other
 *It would be better to have open rooms
 *It also need to have passageways
