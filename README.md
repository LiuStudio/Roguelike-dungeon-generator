# Roguelike-dungeon-generator
A Playground for Dungeon Generator! Have FUN!

##Some Study Notes Here as I am learning the concept of Roguelike Dungeon Generator
 A basic Dungeon Will need the following:
 
 * A Set of itnerconnected rooms, doors and tunnels
 * An entrance
 * An Exit
 * Every space must be reachable

 ##Some Tips from Readings for making a GOOD Dungeon Generator
 
 * It needs to be fairly efficient--generator only runs when the player enters a new level
 * It needs to be connected--from any point in the dungeon, there is a way--posibly circuitous--to any other point
 * It is better that if dungeons to not be perfect--there are more than one ways from one point to the other
 * It would be better to have open rooms
 * It also need to have passageways

some thoughts About architecture of the maze

1. A class object of "room" should have the following propeties: " center location x, y, width, height, corners"
in JavaScript it would be something similar to : 
`
	var room = {
		_id:      <id>	
		"center" : {	
						"x" : x, 
						"y" : y
					} ,

		"size"   : {
						"x-size"  :  w,
						"y-size"  :  l	
					},
		"monster" : null | monster._id, 
		food 	  : null | food._id,
		Armor	  : null | armor._id,

					
	}

	var monsters = [

		{
			_id: <id>,
			name: Name
			attack: (1-10)
			defense: (1-10)
			hp: (1-10)

		}

		{
			...		
		}
	];

	var foods = [

		{
			_id: <id>,
			name: Name
			hp  : (1-5)
		}

		{
			...		
		}
	];
	var armor = [

		{
			_id: <id>,
			name: Name
			attack: (1-10)
			defense: (1-10)
			health: (1-10)

		}

		{
			...		
		}
	];
`
2. First, Room be placed randomly in the stage
	Rule of thumb: 
	1. need some constrian about how many rooms want to insert -- decide average room size, then calculate room max_size and min_size, all room random size all based on this range.
	2, generate and place room one by one in the stage, make sure each room placed is not overlaped with any other room
	   this can be done by push each room object in to array, everytime place a new room, need to run function notoverlap with all the rooms in the array to make sure it doesn't overlap with any of them
	3, To avoid infinit loop, set a certain number of tries, if cannot fit a room, discard current attempt room size, try another randomed size room and restart the placement operation.
	4, until all the rooms are placed in the stage

3. Stage should have pre-defined or user defined entrance or exit


4. Using" flood fill" Algorithem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill fill all the gap/solid area between randomly placed rooms
	This is nothing but a maze generator , A very good tutorial/introduction about many maze generator algorithms by Jamis Buck
	http://www.jamisbuck.org/presentations/rubyconf2011/index.html#edge
	And a detail list of most of the maze generator algorithm
	http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm#perfect


5. open gate at rooms to paths generated by step#4 using flood fill method

6. remove dead end path that are not connecting two rooms

##Some Work is been done for exploring how to display the dungeon in HTML5
Including 
* 1. Canvas HTML5 
* 2. other frameworks
* 3. phaser.io is been looked at and studied
